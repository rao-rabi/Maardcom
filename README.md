Project Overview
This project is a responsive web application built using React and TailwindCSS. The project setup was facilitated by Vite, which is known for its fast and efficient build toolchain. The application includes a basic search functionality that handles state changes, though no API integration was done as none was provided.

1. Run "npm install" to install dependencies.
2. I took almost 7 hours to complete designing almsot 40 to 50 minutes for each section.
3.The application is fully responsive and adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes.
4. I Implemented state management for the search functionality using React's state hooks..
